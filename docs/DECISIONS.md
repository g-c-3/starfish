# Decisions

Numbered log, no dates (see TRACK.md for dates). Terse, factual, no attribution to individuals.

**1. Core model.** Fully offline capture-and-action app. Voice, location, photo, PDF, file, and text
entries convert to searchable text where possible, indexed in one FTS5 timeline. No automated
inference, no external verification, no account or server. Monetized by one rewarded ad per day, max,
only if it loads.

**2. Voice notes carry no transcription.** Recorder only, with a noise-reduction toggle
(`VOICE_COMMUNICATION` audio source, not custom DSP) and a mandatory label. Removes the largest
technical risk (offline speech-to-text) at the cost of voice notes being searchable by label only —
stated explicitly in-app, not left implicit.

**3. Reminders are notifications with a tone, not alarms.** `local-notifications`, not `AlarmManager`
full-screen alarms. Simpler, more tolerant of Doze delays; doesn't force-take the screen. Compensated
with a battery-optimization-exemption prompt on first reminder and an "X scheduled" trust indicator.

**4. Expense follow-up: save first, ask after.** "Spent 500" with no category saves immediately as
`uncategorized`; a 15-second prompt asks what it was for. Never blocks on the answer; a late/no reply
just updates the row already saved.

**5. Three credentials, never conflated.** App-open password, private-notes PIN, backup passkey —
separately scoped, separately recoverable, separately hinted. App-open password recoverable via
backup-passkey-as-proof-of-ownership. Private-notes PIN has no recovery path, even via valid restore,
since the backup passkey only unlocks the archive, not PIN-derived note encryption — only a
destructive PIN reset exists. Backup passkey is never stored; forgetting it makes that backup
permanently unrecoverable. First two hints stored locally; backup-passkey hint lives in the backup
file's own unencrypted header, shown before the passkey prompt at restore.

**6. Normal restore only ever asks for the backup passkey.** App-open password and PIN travel inside
the restored database and resume automatically at their backed-up values — restoring can revert the
app-open password if it changed since backup, surfaced as a one-time notice.

**7. Append is the default restore mode; overwrite is the dangerous, explicit-opt-in path.** Append:
non-destructive, UUID-based dedup (exact match skipped but offer "restore anyway"; same-label/
different-UUID appended with a `(Restored)` suffix). Overwrite: destructive, always shown with its
consequence stated plainly. Safety-backup toggle offered for both; skipping it under append needs no
warning, skipping it under overwrite triggers a warning dialog requiring an explicit "I understand"
tap. If the safety backup itself can't fit, overwrite restore refuses to proceed. Incoming backup must
verify fully before any deletion starts.

**8. Selective backup/restore share one category list**, entry types plus Tags (definitions only,
`INSERT OR IGNORE`, no dedup needed) and App Settings (non-sensitive preferences only — never
credential hashes/salts/hints). Both directions show a storage sanity check (required vs. available)
before the action is enabled. "Extract to device storage" pulls a category's raw files out without
touching the database.

**9. Every entry gets five actions: Share, Download-for-append, Download (plain), Edit, Delete.**
Private notes get Copy (auto-clearing clipboard) instead of Share/Download. Download-for-append always
encrypts; the passkey is optional — skipping it falls back to a fixed, disclosed-as-weaker app-level
default key. Plain Download is always unencrypted, meant to leave the app for good. Per-file zip
sidecar schema (label, tags, timestamps, category) matches the full-backup format — one import/dedup
engine serves both.

**10. Tags and labels are picked from a shared, growing list, never retyped.** One tag-picker
component across every entry type (`listAllTags()`), same pattern as label autocomplete
(`label_history`).

**11. Batch add uses one common label with history-aware auto-numbering.** Multi-select Image/PDF/
Generic-File capture can suffix a running number onto a shared label (`Invoice 1`, `Invoice 2`...),
continuing from the label's last-used number rather than restarting at 1.

**12. App name: Dumpzone.** "Dumpstore" rejected — too close to Dumpster, an established Android
file-recovery app in an adjacent category. "Dumphere" cleared but replaced by "Dumpzone" after a
further conflict check also cleared, keeping the "dump it in" positioning without the "junk"
connotation risk. Package id: `com.dumpzone.app`.

**13. Security hardening ceiling: JS obfuscation, ProGuard/R8, startup signature check.** NDK-level
native obfuscation rejected as not worth the build complexity for a solo, GitHub-Actions-only
pipeline — client-side checks can only raise tamper cost, never eliminate it, since nothing here has
a server to validate against, including the ad-gate logic itself.

**14. Ad gate never blocks data access.** Rewarded ad attempted in background on first open per day,
3–5s timeout. Loads → full-screen, non-skippable. Fails/offline → gate skipped entirely, silently. No
optional/skippable middle state — an ad-gate that could lock out a user's own data over a network
hiccup would contradict the offline-first premise.

**15. Repo holds client + docs only — no server split.** Single repo, no backend to separate out.
Manual APK sideload; no Play Store plan decided yet.

**16. Files are delivered complete, never pushed directly, never as diffs.** Matches the mobile-only,
no-terminal workflow — every file is a full, ready-to-download replacement.

**17. Docs use numbers, not dates.** DECISIONS.md and SESSIONS.md entries are numbered only; TRACK.md
is the sole place mapping any of it to a real date/time.

**18. Dark mode: simple on/off, no auto-detection required for v1.** Stored as a local preference
(`meta.dark_mode`), applied via a `data-theme` attribute and CSS variables. Falls under the App
Settings backup category.

**19. Gradient mode: on/off, independent of dark mode, two user-pickable colors.** Same color allowed
for both — collapses to a single-tone glow rather than a two-tone gradient, by design, not a bug to
guard against. Rendered as a soft background gradient plus a blurred glow/spillover layer behind
cards — pure CSS, cosmetic only, no functional effect. Also falls under App Settings.

**20. Captured file storage path convention: `Directory.Data/files/<uuid>.<extension>`.** Not
previously pinned down; backup/restore needs a fixed convention to read and write against. Files are
named by the owning entry's own id, so a restored file and its DB row always agree.

**21. Full backup is a single AES-GCM-encrypted JSON archive, not a zip.** Keeps the "no external
library" stance (crypto.js only) for Phase 6; file bytes travel base64-encoded inside the JSON.
Per-file download-for-append (Phase 7, Decision 9) is a separate, later decision to use a zip
container — the two share the same entry-record schema but not the same container format.

**22. Overwrite-mode restore is destructive only within the selected categories**, not a full-device
wipe by default. Existing rows in unselected categories are untouched. Selecting every category and
choosing overwrite is how a full replace is done — there's no separate "wipe everything" switch.

**23. App icon generated from one source file via `@capacitor/assets` in CI**, not hand-crafted
per-density PNGs. `resources/icon.png` is the only file to touch when the icon changes; no separate
adaptive-icon foreground/background layers exist yet since only one flattened image was supplied —
revisit if launcher-mask cropping turns out to be a problem on a real device.

**24. Icon source images must be supplied full-bleed (artwork to the edges), not pre-padded.** The
adaptive-icon generator applies its own safe-zone inset; a source that already carries margin stacks
with that inset and renders visibly smaller than sibling icons on the launcher — confirmed on-device
(Session 7) and fixed by re-cropping `resources/icon.png` to ~2–6% margin. Any future icon swap
follows this same rule.

**25. Google Drive backup is opt-in and additive, never a replacement for local backup.** Local-only
stays the default and fully functional with no account, forever. Connecting a Google account adds a
second destination for the same backup file; nothing about local capture, search, or backup/restore
starts depending on it.

**26. Drive access uses the `drive.file` OAuth scope only** — the app can see/manage only files it
created itself, never the rest of the person's Drive. Chosen specifically because it's Google's
non-sensitive tier: basic verification only, not the restricted-scope security assessment full or
readonly Drive access would require.

**27. The Google Cloud OAuth consent screen must be published to Production, not left in Testing.**
Testing-mode refresh tokens for non-basic scopes expire after 7 days, which would silently break
time-based auto-backup about a week in. Production removes that limit without triggering full manual
verification, since the scope (Decision 26) stays non-sensitive.

**28. A Drive backup is byte-for-byte the same encrypted archive format as a local backup** (Decision
21) — same passphrase, same KDF, same "never stored" rule. Drive only ever holds the opaque encrypted
blob; one engine, two destinations.

**29. Auto-backup to Drive is time-based (daily/weekly, user-configurable)**, with manual "Backup now"
always available regardless of the auto-backup setting. Requires a background scheduling mechanism
not yet chosen (Phase 13) — everything in the app today is foreground-only or a local notification.
"Fully offline" language across docs/UI updates to "offline-first, optional cloud backup" once this
ships, since the old phrasing stops being accurate the moment Drive backup exists as a feature.

**30. No refresh-token/serverAuthCode store for Drive auth.** `gdrive.js` never requests
`grantOfflineAccess`; it calls `GoogleAuth.signIn()` fresh each time, relying on the native Android
SDK's own silent-consent caching. Nothing of our own to persist or secure beyond what Android's
account manager already handles.

**31. Auto-backup is a check on app open/resume, not `@capacitor/background-runner`.** That plugin's
headless JS environment has no SQLite or Filesystem access (confirmed against the Capacitor 6 docs) —
it cannot read entries or captured files, so it cannot build a backup payload, independent of any
timing/battery concerns. AlarmManager/a foreground service were also passed over, consistent with the
existing choice to keep reminders as local notifications rather than alarms. The tradeoff is explicit:
if the app isn't opened, no auto-backup runs — an honest, visible limit rather than a silent one.

**32. A due auto-backup shows a one-tap passkey prompt, never runs fully silently.** The backup
passkey is never stored (existing credentials rule), so `checkAndRunAutoBackupIfDue()` can't cache it
across sessions — when the schedule says a backup is due, the app shows a small banner asking for the
passkey once, with an explicit "Skip this time" option that leaves `last_drive_backup_at` untouched so
it comes due again next open rather than silently waiting out the full interval.
